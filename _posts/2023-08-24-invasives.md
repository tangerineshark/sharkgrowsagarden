# Invasives
- Goutweed
- Feverfew
- Greater Celandine
- Soapwort

How am I mitigating these? So far, just pulling them out with as much root as I can snag, in the hopes of eventually depriving them of carbohydrates as relevant. For the goutweed and soapwort, I try to get them as soon as possible in the hopes of their slow death by starvation. For the feverfew and greater celandine, I try to get them before they go to seed.
