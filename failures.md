# Failures
- Spotted Horsemint (Monarda punctata) - got mildewy and wasn't getting enough sun between the daylilies
- Corsican Mint (Mentha requienii) - I keep trying to plant it as a groundcover and it keeps shriveling up and dying, rudely
- English Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) - doesn't get enough sunlight, so it get rangy and then doesn't successfully overwinter (possibility this is also because the roots are too wet)
- Coreopsis Hybrid 'Jethro Tull' - got rangier and rangier, then turned brown and crispy before losing all its flowers and leaves; def lost at least one other coreopsis before, so I guess my natural dying dreams aren't meant to be
