# Invasives
- Spotted Horsemint (Monarda punctata) - got mildewy and wasn't getting enough sun between the daylilies
- Corsican Mint (Mentha requienii) - I keep trying to plant it as a groundcover and it keeps shriveling up and dying, rudely
- English Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) - doesn't get enough sunlight, so it get rangy and then doesn't successfully overwinter (possibility this is also because the roots are too wet)
